I created a social networking Application using ReactJS and dummy APIs, enabling
users to create, view, and delete posts within the platform. The user-friendly interface facilitates smooth interaction
and data administration, garnering favorable comments for its ease of use. This project showcases the development
of an operational social networking platform with core functionalities for user involvement.
